React is javascript library to build user interfaces.

User interface- whatever you see on the browser that is known as UI. You are providing something to the user to 
interact with application. So react helps you to build those UIs.

library- What is library, it has just one thing to perform. library comes with nothing just one purpose.

framework- what is framework, it is whole package of something or packages of libraries. framework has everything
which you need while building an application. framework comes with everything but some framework allows you to
install libraries along with this and some doesnt.

animation and routers you have to install some other libraries.
